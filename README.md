# Android App Remote Control Joystick

Android application that implements a joystick that controls the FlightGear (Flight Simulator) software. 

## Architecture
This App based on MVVM software architectural pattern that has three main parts that run it, each part with its own designated responsibilities. </br>
The Model interacts with FlightGear via TCP connection, continuously send and read data request and notifies the relevant ViewModel when it's data changed. </br>
Next, the ViewModels process the changed data and notifies the Views about the changed data. </br>
The View then react to the changed data accordingly and shows them.
* Model: responsible for connect to flightGear and send requests to it.
* View:  responsible for showing the joystick and the seekBars to the screen.
* View Model: responsible to connect between the view and the model.

## Features

The main_activity window contains 2 fields for entering IP & Port, as well as a CONNECT butten that is responsible for connecting to the flight simulator. </br>

This window displays also the Joystick which allows the user to change the aileron, elevator, rudder and throttle values using a joystick and two seek bars, and responsible for controlling the plane's flight.</br>

* The aileron movement in values [-1, 1]. </br>
* The elevator movement in values [-1, 1].</br>
* The rudder movement in values [-1, 1].</br>
* The throttle movement in values [0, 1].</br>

The joystick sends SET commands to the flight simulator via TCP/IP communication protocol when the app is the client while the simulator is the server.</br>
The connection to the server is created when the Activity is created and is closed when the Activity is destroyed.</br>

## Installation
1. Download & install FlightGear version 2020.3.8 </br>
2. Use Android Studio version 4.2.1 and above.  </br>

## Running the Application
1. Open the 'FlightGear' application and go to settings -> additional settings and insert the folowing line: </br>
--telnet=socket,in,10,10.0.0.25,6400,tcp  </br>
2. Click on "Fly" button in the FlightGear application. </br>
3. Open Android Studio and Clone the project. </br>
4. Run the application. </br>
5. Enter your IP address and the PORT (6400). </br>
6. Click the "CONNECT" Button. </br>
